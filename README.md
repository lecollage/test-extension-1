# Chrome Extension Example (TypeScript + Vite)

This project is a minimal Google Chrome extension built with TypeScript and Vite.

Features:

- Clicking the extension button opens a popup.
- The popup shows:
  - the current time, updated every second
  - the time when the popup was opened
  - a counter of how many times the popup has been opened
- The same counter is also shown on the extension button badge.

   ```bash
   npm install

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
